# sage-jupyter
Sage files (via Jupyter Notebooks) that give an introduction to using Sage.

Originally created as a project for Math 4220 at Southen Utah University, this project will guide the user through installing Sage and Jupyter Notebooks.  Then the user will be introduced to basic computations in Sage, as well as experimenting with group theory.  Sage provides a rich environment for visualizing and experimenting with groups, including functionality with subgroups, cayley tables, isomorphisms, and more.
