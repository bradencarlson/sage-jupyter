# sage-jupyter
Sage files (via Jupyter Notebooks) that give an introduction to using Sage.

Originally created as a project for Math 4220 at Southen Utah University, this project will guide the user through installing Sage and Jupyter Notebooks.  Then the
user will be introduced to basic computations in Sage, as well as experimenting with group theory.  Sage provides a rich environment for visualizing and 
experimenting with groups, including functionality with subgroups, cayley tables, isomorphisms, and more.

The goal of this project is to help students everywhere, although it is primarily aimed at students of Abstract Algebra, to learn the syntax of SageMath, so as 
to provide them with a helpful tool to visualize and understand the topics taught in an undergraduate Abstract Algebra course.  While doing this, this project 
will also guide the user through a few important and very interesting applications of the theory that is being studied, such as the Ceasar Cipher, the RSA 
Encryption system, as well as Algebraic Coding theory.   

## Basic Introduction

In this project we will discuss how to [install SageMath](Installation/sage-installation.md) as well as how to
[install Jupyter Notebooks](Installation/jupyter-installation.md) onto a local machine to get the user up and running with both of these powerful programs.

We well then guide the user on how to [run a Jupyter Notebook Server](Running/running-jupyter.md).  Once these preliminary tasks are taken care of, we begin the 
discussion of selected topics in Abstract Algebra.  This will take place in a number of Jupyter Notebooks.  Note that the sequence of these notebooks will follow 
the Youtube series of [Abstract Algebra lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz7t89zv8Lp2D6xQOG7kUEbN1KP5u-mpH) given by Dr. Andrew Misseldine at 
Southen Utah University.  

We will mention here that learning the SageMath syntax is much like learning any other computer programming language, in that it is done through much trial and 
error.  Many of the documents here in this project are set up to run without the user having much knowledge about how the language works.  Thus any student of 
SageMath will find this project helpful in their journey to using SageMath. 

## Python

As Jupyter Notebooks allows SageMath documents to be downloaded as Python documents, In the [Python](Python) folder, you will find all the documents used in this 
project in the form of Python files.  Please go to that folder for more details regarding the use of Python in this project.
