# sage-jupyter
Sage files (via Jupyter Notebooks) that give an introduction to using Sage.

Originally created as a project for Math 4220 at Southen Utah University, this project will guide the user through installing Sage and Jupyter Notebooks.  Then the
user will be introduced to basic computations in Sage, as well as experimenting with group theory.  Sage provides a rich environment for visualizing and 
experimenting with groups, including functionality with subgroups, cayley tables, isomorphisms, and more.

The goal of this project is to help students everywhere, although it is primarily aimed at students of Abstract Algebra, to learn the syntax of SageMath, so as 
to provide them with a helpful tool to visualize and understand the topics taught in an undergraduate Abstract Algebra course.  While doing this, this project 
will also guide the user through a few important and very interesting applications of the theory that is being studied, such as the Ceasar Cipher, the RSA 
Encryption system, as well as Algebraic Coding theory.  

Please see the [start here](START-HERE.md) file for information about getting started with this project.
