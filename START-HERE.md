# Basic Introduction

This project was created as a project for Math 4220 at Southen Utah University. The goal of this project is to aide students, specifically students of Abstract Algebra, in learning about SageMath, and applying that knowledge to Abstract Algebra theory and some applications as well.  In this project we will discuss how to [install SageMath](Installation/sage-installation.md) as well as how to [install Jupyter Notebooks](Installation/jupyter-installation.md) onto a local machine to get the user up and running with both of these powerful programs.

We well then guide the user on how to [run a Jupyter Notebook Server](running-jupyter.md).  Once these preliminary tasks are taken care of, we begin the discussion of selected topics in Abstract Algebra.  This will take place in a number of Jupyter Notebooks.  Note that the sequence of these notebooks will follow the Youtube series of [Abstract Algebra lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz7t89zv8Lp2D6xQOG7kUEbN1KP5u-mpH) given by Dr. Andrew Misseldine at Southen Utah University.  

We will mention here that learning the SageMath syntax is much like learning any other computer programming language, in that it is done through much trial and error.  Many of the documents here in this project are set up to run without the user having much knowledge about how the language works.  Thus any student of SageMath will find this project helpful in their journey to using SageMath.
