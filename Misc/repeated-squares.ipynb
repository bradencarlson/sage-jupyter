    "# Repeated Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we discuss the Repeated Squares algorithm, and we discuss one method of implementing this algorithm in SageMath.  Of course, SageMath already contains a function that can perform these operations for us, but this will give us some insight on how a program might perform operations such as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a^b \\mod n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where both $b$ and $n$ are very large numbers.  The repeated Squares algorithm goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to write $b$ in binary, assume that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b=b_n 2^n+b_{n-1}2^{n-1}+\\cdots +b_12+b_0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $b_i=0,1$.  Then we compute each of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "a \\mod n\\\\\n",
    "a^2 \\mod n \\\\\n",
    "(a^2)^2=a^4 \\mod n\\\\\n",
    "(a^4)^2=a^8 \\mod n\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots\\\\\n",
    "a^{2^n}\\mod n\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can compute\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*} \n",
    "a^b &=& a^{b_n2^n+\\cdots+b_12+b_0}\\\\\n",
    "&\\equiv& \\left(a^{2^n}\\right)^{b_n} \\left(a^{2^{n-1}}\\right)^{b_{n-1}}\\cdots \\left(a^{2}\\right)^{b_1}\\left(a\\right)^{b_0}\\mod n\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that during the repeated squares process above, since we can reduce after each step, we never need to deal with any number greater than $n^2-1$.  Thus the final multiplication is managable also reducing at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will go into how to write a program that can perform this operation in a reasonable amount of time. We will first go into how to write the number $b$ in binary.  We note that by the Division Algorithm, we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b = 2q_0+b_0 \\quad\\text{where}\\quad b_0\\in\\{0,1\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we could write \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q_0=2q_1+b_1 \\quad\\text{where}\\quad b_1\\in \\{0,1\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And this gives rise to the equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b = 2^2q_1+2b_1+b_0 \\quad\\text{where}\\quad b_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing this process will give rise to the digits of $b$ in binary, until eventually we reach some $q_n=0$, then the process is complete.  Thus the last digit of $b$ in binary is simply the remainder of $b/2$.  Then if we take the quotient from $b/2$, the next digit is obtained by taking the remainder of the quotient $q_0/2$, and so on.  We demonstrate this in the following code."
