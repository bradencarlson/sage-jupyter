    "* The Special Linear Group\n",
    "* The Orthogonal Group\n",
    "* The Special Orthogonal Group\n",
    "* and the Unitary Group\n",
    "\n",
    "In SageMath, these groups are use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Group Name |   Syntax |\n",
    "|---------------|----------|\n",
    "|    General Linear Group of degree $n$ over field $F$:    |    GL($n$,$F$)    |\n",
    "|    Special Linear Group of degree $n$ over field $F$:    |    SL($n$,$F$)    |\n",
    "|    Orthogonal Group of degree $n$ over field $F$:        |    GO($n$,$F$)    |\n",
    "|    Special Orthogonal Group of degree $n$ over field $F$:|    SO($n$,$F$)    |\n",

    "|    Special Unitary Group of degree $n$ over field $F$:   |    SU($n$,$F$)    |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also make a note here that the field $\\mathbb{R}$ in SageMath is denoted $RR$ and the field $\\mathbb{C}$ is denoted $CC$.  Finite fields are denoted GF($p$), where $p$ is necessarily a prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we go over an example, we note that from Linear Algebra, that the area of the parallelogram given by two vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is \n",

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "A=\\det([\\vec{x}\\:\\: \\vec{y}]) \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec{x}$ and $\\vec{y}$ are written as column vectors.  Thus if we take any element of $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, then we have that the area of the parallelogram with sides $A\\vec{x}$ and $A\\vec{y}$ is the same as the area of the parallelogram with sides $\\vec{x}$ and $\\vec{y}$.  We leave the proof to the reader, but provide numerical evidence here. "
