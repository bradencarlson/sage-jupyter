    "This document will be all about exploring cosets in SageMath.  We have previously looked at how to define groups, and how to define elements of those groups as well as performing operations on those elements.  Now we will look at how to perform operations on subgroups of a group, that is calculating the coset of a group.  Recall that for a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$, the left coset of $H$ with respresentative $g\\in G$ is defined to be $$ gH=\\{gh:h\\in H\\}.$$ Similarly for right cosets.  Here we define two functions that, when passed a subgroup, and an element of the parent group, will calculate the left coset, or the right coset, respectively.  "
