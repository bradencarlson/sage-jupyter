SageMath uses a notation that we may not have seen before if we are still being introduced to Groups in Abstract Algebra.  It is refered to as cycle notation, and if you are in an Undergraduate Abstract Algebra class, you will probably be introduced to cycle notation soon.  A cycle $ (1,3,2) $ in sage denotes a permutation that sends $1\\mapsto 3$, $3\\mapsto 2$ and $2\\mapsto 1$, they are used extensively in Group theory with permutations.

Also notice that $10\\mid 24!$, which is the order of the Symmetric Group on 24 numbers. This is no coincidence, as we will see later, but not supprising, as every number from 1 to 24 divides $24!$.  Let's look at another example, and also introduce the order of an element, in group theory, the order of an element $g$ is the least natural number $n$ such that $g^n=1$, the identity element of the group. In the last cell, we saw that the order of a specific element divided the order of the group, let's explore this further in the next cell."

(If you are not conviced, you can add an `else` statement inside the `for` loop to print out a message or the order of the element) This cell takes every element of the group $D_8$ and checks to see if it's order divides the order of the group or not; if not, then it prints out a message saying so.  As we saw no messages printed out, we must conclude that the order of every element of $D_8$ divides the order of the group.  This is a special case of Lagrange's Theorem.
