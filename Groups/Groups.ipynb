SageMath uses a notation that we may not have seen before if we are still being introduced to Groups in Abstract Algebra.  It is refered to as cycle notation, and if you are in an Undergraduate Abstract Algebra class, you will probably be introduced to cycle notation soon.  A cycle $ (1,3,2) $ in sage denotes a permutation that sends $1\\rightarrow 3$, $3\\rightarrow 2$ and $2\\rightarrow 1$, they are used extensively in Group theory with permutations.  So in the Dihedral group above, we see the two rotations of a triangle, and the three reflections, as well as the identity $()$. \n",
