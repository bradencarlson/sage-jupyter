# Running Jupyter Notebooks

## Linux

To run Jupyter Notebooks in Linux after it has been [installed](../Installation/jupyter-installation.md), we have a few options.  To start Jupyter Notebooks at your home directory, type the command `jupyter notebook`.  There are a few options we can use at the command prompt when using this command, see `man jupyter notebooks` for more information.  Alternatively, assuming that SageMath has been [installed](../Installation/sage-installation.md) correctly, we can use the command `sage -n jupyter`, which will start Jupyter Notebooks at our home directory.
