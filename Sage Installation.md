# Installation of Sage

Installing sage can seem tricky, but it is not so bad.  We will talk about how to install Sage on your local computer running Linux, Windows, or MacOS.  

### Linux

This is by far the easiest operating system on which to install Sage.  To do so, open a terminal, and use your distributions package manager to install Sage. 
For instance, on my dsitribution, which is LinuxMint, I type

> `sudo apt install sage`

Then, after the installation process is complete, I can use the command `sage` to start sage in the command line.  

### Windows

To install Sgae on Windows, navigate to the github repository [SageMath Windows Installer](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/releases) to download the installation file.  When the file has finished downloading, run the file to start the installation process. It will ask you to confirm that it has selected the correct home directory and installation path, the defaults that it has preselected are good for the vast majority of installations.  Once the installation script has finished, Sage is installed onto you machine, if you left this option selected, desktop shortcuts should now have been created to launch Sage.

### MacOS
