# Installation of Sage

Installing sage can seem tricky, but it is not so bad.  We will talk about how to install Sage on your local computer running Linux, Windows, or MacOS.  

## Linux

This is by far the easiest operating system on which to install Sage.  To do so, open a terminal, and use your distributions package manager to install Sage. 
For instance, on my dsitribution, which is LinuxMint, I type

> `sudo apt install sage`
