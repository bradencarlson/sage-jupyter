    "In this document, we discuss dictionaries, a powerful data structure in Python that are similar to lists.  While lists contain an array of items, that can be accessed via their index, dictionaries contain key-value pairs.  Much like real dictionaries, Python dictionaries keep track of a certain number of items, as well as their values in a single structure.  We demonstrate this in the following example."
