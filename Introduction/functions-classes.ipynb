In the function declaration, we use the keyword `def`, which is short for define, to let the interpreter know that we are defining a function.  Then we specify the name of the function, and what parameters are needed to use the function.  In this case, the paramter is `x`, and has to be of type `list`.  Then, as we have seen before, we declare a new variable total, sum all the numbers in the list `x`, then we devide the total by the number of elements in `x`, and return that average.  Below we can see this function being used."
