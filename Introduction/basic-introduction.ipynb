    "This will be a basic introduction to SageMath, and its syntax, to provide us the tools we will need to study some Abstract Algebra.  First of all, each input and output box is referred to as a cell.  SageMath will only run one cell at a time unless instructed to do otherwise. All SageMath code is run in the Sage kernel, which can be used outside of Jupyter Notebooks, although Jupyter provides us with a good environment to develop our understanding, so we will be using Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sage, if a cell has a box around it with a blue tab on the left side, this means we have selected that cell in Command mode, while if a cell has a box around it with a green tab on the left side, this indicates that we have selected that cell in Edit mode.  If we are in Command mode (blue), we can use the keys `j` and `k` to move our selection down and up, respectively (the arrow keys also work).  We need to be very careful though, while in Command mode, the command `dd` will delete the current cell and Sage will not ask you if you are sure that you want to delete it.  For this reason, I recommend using the command `ctrl + S` frequently, which creates a checkpoint, just in case we make any mistakes.  There are many keyboard commands that you could accidentally type while in Command mode,  click on `help` and then `keyboard shortcuts` to see more.  If at any point, we accidentally delete somthing, we can open `file` and then select `revert to checkpoint` to undo any changes since the last checkpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we open a document that we have already created, the SageMath kernel does not remember anything that we have already written in the document, each cell must be run again if the kernel is to use any information contained in that cell.  For example, in the next cell, we define a varible `x = 56`, then in the following cell, we use the `print` function to print out the value of `x`.  While in Command mode, use the command `Ctrl+Enter` to run the following two cells to see this in action. \n",

    "If done correctly, we should now see the number 56 below the statement `print(x)`.  Here we introduce a few more operators that we will use frequenly, `=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, and `//`.  Most of these work how we would expect them to. That is, `+` is addition, `-` is subtraction, and `*` and `/` are multiplication and division.  In Sage, the `=` operator is not used as a statement of equality, but rather as an assignment.  Take for example the code above, this cell **assigns** the variable `x` the value of 56, we will see many examples of this and use it often.  The `%` operator gives us the residue mod *n* of a number.  The `//` operator will give us the quotient when one number is divided by the other.  For example:"

If you are familiar with Python, first of all this introduction must seem pretty dull, but the syntax of the code will be pretty much the same, although we will see in the future some things that we can use in SageMath that are not readily available to us in Python.  When we wish to format a String in Python (or in SageMath), one way of doing so is to put the letter `f` in front of the string itself, and then any variable that we place in brackets in the string will be formatted as its value.
