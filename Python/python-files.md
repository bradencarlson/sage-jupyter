# Python Files

In Jupyter Notebooks, when working with any type of document we have that option to export that document as a text file, as markdown, and a number
of other options.  While working with a SageMath document, we have the option of downloading the document as a Python document.  We need to be very careful when 
doing this, since some of the functions that we are using in SageMath in our documents are not available in Python.  Thus if we download any one of our documents 
as a Python document, we will still need to run it as a SageMath document.  

Also note that in some of the documents that have been prepared and uploaded as part of this project, there are intentional mistakes in the code to 
demonstrate to the the user how SageMath reports these errors.  When downloading these files as python files, even while running them as a SageMath document,
once the error is encountered, execution of the file will stop.  For the majority of the documents in this project this will not be a problem, as they all
run without runtime errors.
