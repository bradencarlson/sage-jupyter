    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Here we go over a brief inroduction to SageMath, and its syntax, to provide
    us with the tools that we need to study some Abstract Algebra. Let's take
    a look at the following cell.  We can easily define variables, perform various
    operations on them, and have them printed out to the screen.</p>

    <div class="sage">
      <script type="text/x-sage">
x = 103454
y = 34865
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x+y}")
print(f"x/y = {x/y}")
print(f"x mod y = {x%y}")
print(f"The quotient when x is divided by y is {x//y}")
print(2^8)

x = 10^500
print(x/6.745)
      </script>
    </div>
    <p>Also note the optional use of f-strings.  This is a feture inherited from
    Python, when a string is preceeded by an f, then any variable that appears
    in backets will have it's value printed, rather than the variable name.</p>

    <p>We can also combine variables to form other variables in SageMath.  This will
    be very useful as we explore more complicated examples throughout this
    series.</p>

    <div class="sage">
      <script type="text/x-sage">
x = 5.67
y = 3.45423
z = 9.3861

total = x + y + z
average = total/3

print(f"The average of these three numbers is {average}")

      </script>
    </div>

    <p>We will also need to know a little about types of data.  There are many
    different types of data that we can define, and we have already seen a few!
    consider the following cell.</p>

    <div class="sage">
      <script type="text/x-sage">
x = 56
y = "hello"
print(f"The type of x is {type(x)} and the type of y is {type(y)}")


      </script>
    </div>

    <p>We see that not only do x and y have different values, but they are of
    different types. One is an integer, the other a string.  Sage will tell
    us if something is wrong with our code, let's see an example.</p>

    <div class="sage">
      <script type="text/x-sage">
x+y
      </script>
    </div>

    <p>We should see an error appear, telling us that we can't add these two different
    types of data together.
