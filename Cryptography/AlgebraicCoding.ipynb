    "SageMath provides a great environment to play with the concepts of Algebraic Coding Theory.  If you have not already, I would highly recommend watching Dr. Andrew Misseldine's [Abstract Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox-_-D5bMyk&list=PLz7t89zv8Lp2D6xQOG7kUEbN1KP5u-mpH&index=80) videos on Coding Theory and Binary Symmetric Channels, note that the link leads to the first of several videos on this topic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In SageMath, there are a few new topics we need to be introduced to before we can experiment with Group Codes and encoding messages and transmitting them over a binary symmetric channel.  The first is a new class object called a `MatrixSpace`.  Creating a MatrixSpace will allow us to create matrices and utilize them as our encoding and check matrices for our code.  The second is the command `GF(2)`, which specifies a Field of size 2.  We will use this field for our Matrix Space, since `GF(2)` is implemented as the set {0,1} in SageMath.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we specify two Matrix Spaces, both over `GF(2)`, one of which consists of all 6x3 matrices and the other all 3x6 matrices.  This will give us the tools to define our canonical parity check matrices.  We also define G and H just as Dr. Misseldine defines them in the example he uses in his videos.  "

Note that objects of type Bernoulli require a parameter `p`, which will be the probability of success.  We also define the class SymmetricChannel.  This will act as a Binary Symmetric Channel for us to send messages over with some probability of errors.  Each object of type SymmetricChannel needs a Bernoulli distribution to accompany it.  To test whether or not the SymmetricChannel is set up correctly with a Bernoulli distribution, I have provided a function `test()`, which will tell us whether or not our SymmetricChannel is ready to go.  Do not change anything in this cell."
