# Installing Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks is a convenient way of veiwing, editing, and dealing with files in general, not just Sage files.  Although we will focus on using Sage in Jupyter Notebooks, it can be used for many other things.  

To install Jupyter Notebooks on Linux, search your package manager for jupyter.

To install Jupyter Notebooks on Windows and MacOS, go to [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install), and follow the instructions to install Jupyter
Notebooks onto your machine.
