# Installation of SageMath

Installing SageMath can seem tricky, but here we will go through the entire process to get SageMath up and running on a computer.  

### Linux

This is by far the easiest operating system on which to install Sage.  To do so, open a terminal, and use your distributions package manager to install Sage. 
For instance, on my dsitribution, which is LinuxMint, I type

> `sudo apt install sage`

Then, after the installation process is complete, I can use the command `sage` to start SageMath in the command line.  

### Windows

To install SageMath on Windows, navigate to the github repository [SageMath Windows Releases](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/releases) to download the 
installation file.  When the file has finished downloading, run the file to start the installation process. It will ask you to confirm that it has selected the 
correct home directory and installation path, the defaults that it has preselected are good for the vast majority of installations.  Once the installation script
has finished, SageMath has been installed onto you machine, if you left this option selected, desktop shortcuts should now have been created to launch SageMath.

Similar instructions can be found on the site where the installation file is available for download.

### MacOS

The installation process for MacOS users is very similar to the installation process for Windows users.  Navigate to the Github repository
[SageMath MacOS Releases](https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases) to download the latest release of Sage.  Once the file has finished
downloading, you can run it to install SageMath onto your machine.  

Similar instructions can be found on the site where the installation file is available for download.
